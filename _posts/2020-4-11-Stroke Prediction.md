A stroke is a serious life-threatening medical condition that happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off. According to CDC, someone in the United States has stroke every 40 seconds, and every 4 minutes, someone dies of stroke. Every year, more than 795,000 people in the United States have a stroke. About 610,000 of these are first or new strokes. About 185,000 strokes, nearly 1 of 4, are in people who have had a previous stroke. Stroke-related costs in the United States came to nearly $46 billion between 2014 and 2015. This total includes the cost of health care services, medicines to treat stroke, and missed days of work. Stroke is also a leading cause of serious long-term disability. Stroke reduces mobility in more than half of stroke survivors age 65 and over. Because of the life-threatening nature of stroke, it is extremely important to take early action. Know the warning signs and symptoms of stroke so that one can act fast if you or someone you know might be having a stroke. The chances of survival are greater when emergency treatment begins quickly. In addition, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking, obesity and diabetes are generally regarded as leading causes of stroke, while 1 in 3 adults in the United States has at least one of these conditions, making the prediction of stroke risk even more important as compared to other population without these conditions.
