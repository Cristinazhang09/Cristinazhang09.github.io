This program provides an option for a user whether or not to look up the weather information for a city by input 'Yes' or 'No'. If the input is 'Yes', the program will further asks the user for the ZipCode or city name he/she wants to loop up. This information will be combined with the api key and base url to generate the url for the city in the weather service website. Requests is used to collect the information, the corresponding weather information is then converted to JSON format, and be displayed. The general weather information including current, feels-like, min/max temperature, and wind speed and direction is displayed.
