The motivation of this project is to answer whether the quality of wine can be predicted from its physical quantities or not. The features provided include acidity (fixed, volatile), sugar content, sulfur dioxide content, density, pH value, sulphates, alcohol, etc. The features are correlated. This project also provides a good platform to practice R programming as well as statistical analysis.
There are 6 levels of wine quality, and the data is very imbalanced, making it difficult for prediction.
