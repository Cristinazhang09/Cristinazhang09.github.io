This project is to use unsupervised methdologies to cluster taxonomy categories from different retailers to a unified taxonomy. At the current stage, I focus on the first tier taxonomy of products. TF-IDF topic modelling, TF-IDF+K-Means, and Bert-Senetence embedding+K-means clustering have been implemented.
