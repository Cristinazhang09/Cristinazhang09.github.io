A house is one of the most valuable economic assets a person can purchase during his/her life. Thus, it is very important to make the right decision whether to buy a house or not and at the right price as well. In common, different people might have different reasons to buy houses, for example, a family has a school age kid or school age kids might be more interested in buying a house which has a good public school in the region, people do not have a big budget might look for a relatively cheap house. Also, some houses are pretty old yet still have high listed prices for sale. What are the important factors to determine the price of a house, can we accurately predict the house price with the house information? If the model is able to predict the house prices, it could be used by those people who are looking for a new house, the potential buyer could compare the listed price with the predicted price and see whether it is a good invest or not.
