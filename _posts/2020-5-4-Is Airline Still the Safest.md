In January 2020, a Boeing 737-800 operating as Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 from Tehran, Iran to Kyiv, Ukraine, crashes shortly after takeoff from Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport, killing all 167 passengers and 9 crew. In February 2020, a Boeing 737-800 operating Pegasus Airlines Flight 2193 from Izmir skids off the runway on landing at Istanbul Sabiha Gökçen International Airport, and breaks into pieces. Three people were killed and 179 injured. These tragedies raised great concern over the airline safety, as it looks like more and more fetal airline accidents are happening. Is airline still the safest mean of transportation?
