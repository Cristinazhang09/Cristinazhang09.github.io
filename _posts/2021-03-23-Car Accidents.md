The purpose of my project is to use find out the importance of different climatic factors correspond to the accidents and severity. My data is a countrywide traffic accident dataset. The dataset covers 49 states of the United States, and the data are collected form February 2016 to December 2019, approximately 3 million accident records in this dataset. This project uses statistical analysis to find the relaionship between climatic factors and accidents severity. 

## Installation
The code requires Python versions of 3.* and general libraries.

## Project Motivation and Description
According car accidents statistics, there are nearly 6 million car accidents in the United States every year. Approximately 1.25 million people die in road crashed each year, in addition, 20-50 million people are injured, many of them even have long-term disabilities. Due to car accidents, many people lose properties, health, especially, people lose their loved ones. Thus, I determine to analyze a countywide car accident dataset. I calculated the covariance and Spearman's correlation between independent variables and dependent variable. p-Test was run to confirm the relationship between indepdent variable and dependent variable. Multiple linear regression was performed, small eigenvalue was detected, suggesting strong multicollinearity between variables.  

## Results

## Limitations
I think analyzing climate should be limited in a state or nearby state, different states have different climate even though there are in the same season, the analysis cannot get precise result.
