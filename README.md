## About Me

Iâ€™m a student data scientist, experienced in Python, R, and hand-on experience in SQL. I am familiar with Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Git, Pandas, Tableau, mySQL, Matplotlib, Numpy 
and Scipy. I am also trained in Machine learning, Natural Language Processing and Time series analysis.

## My Projects

### Data Mining
- [Data Mining](https://github.com/Cristinazhang09/Jingru_projects/tree/main/Data%20Mining): Implemented the apriori algorithm for frequent item set mining and association rule learning.

### Statistic Analysis and Machine Learning
- [Omaha Housing Price](https://github.com/Cristinazhang09/Jingru_projects/tree/main/Omaha%20Housing%20Price): Scraped the zillow house data in Omaha-Lincoln Metro using BeautifulSoup and requests, applied linear regression, support vector machine and random forest regression for the house price, identified factors like roof type and school rate as determing factors for house price.

- [Boston Neighborhood Dataset Preparation](https://github.com/Cristinazhang09/Jingru_projects/tree/main/Boston%20Neighborhood%20Dataset%20Preparation): Put together a dataset using Boston crime data, scraped boston house data from zillow, and neighborhood data using the foursquare API. 

- [Weather Data Scraping](https://github.com/Cristinazhang09/Jingru_projects/tree/main/Weather%20Data%20Scraping): Using requests, implemented a program to interact with the OpenWeatherMap service and print out the weather information for the city based ZipCode or city name.

-[Merchandise Category Clustering](https://github.com/Cristinazhang09/Jingru_projects/tree/main/Merchandise%20Category%20Clustering): Used Bert sentence embedding, performed clustering analysis of online product category data.

- [Car Accidents](https://github.com/Cristinazhang09/Jingru_projects/tree/main/Car%20Accidents): Peroformed hypothesis test on car accident data, identified the correlation climatic factors and accident severity with 95% confidence.

### R
- [Wine Quality](https://github.com/Cristinazhang09/Jingru_projects/tree/main/Wine%20Quality): Analyzed the determing facrot of Wine Quality using R through linear regression. 

### Tableau
- [US Air Crash Analysis](https://github.com/Cristinazhang09/Jingru_projects/tree/main/US%20Air%20Crash%20Analysis): Analyzed US air crash using Tableau.

- [Is Airline Still Trustworthy](https://github.com/Cristinazhang09/Jingru_projects/tree/main/Airline%20Is%20Still%20Trustworthy): Using Tableau, presented different data and graphs to convey that airline is still trustworthy for traveller.

- [Is Airline Still the Safest]https://github.com/Cristinazhang09/Jingru_projects/tree/main/Is%20Airlines%20Still%20the%20Safest): Using Tableau, presented different data and graphs to persuade that airline is still the safest mean of transportation in United States.
